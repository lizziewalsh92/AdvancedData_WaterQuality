        <h1> Dirty Champagne: NYC’s Water Is Not As Clean As We Think</h1>
        <h3>NYC's Department of Environmental Protection reports boast of clean water at the street—but <span style="font-weight: 800; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">new data analysis</span> of water tank inspections and apartment water samples shows that New York drinking water may be laced with hazards like lead, E. coli, and rodent droppings.</h3>

        When Julia Porter moved into her new apartment, she noticed a green ring of fungus forming in the toilet bowl and a strange, brownish-green tint in the bathtub water. After a few weeks, she developed persistent acne, an unusual occurrence for her. <br> <br></p>

            Porter ordered a Varify water test kit to check for contaminants in her tap water.

        <p>“At first, I thought it was mineral deposits in my showerhead, so I replaced it. But my skin didn’t change, and the tub and sink water still looked gross,” said Porter, 27, who had just moved from the East Village to a condo in Williamsburg. <br> <br>
        Across town, Andre, a longtime resident of NYCHA’s Gowanus Houses, faces similar issues. <br> <br></p>

        <p>“Three or four times a month the water runs brown. Sometimes I wait an hour for it to clear or run to the store for bottled water before it sells out,” said Andre, who now drinks only bottled water. Many other residents at Gowanus Houses say they have also given up on drinking water from the tap for fear of contaminants.<br> <br>
        A recent <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Qymx2rMaYyiWdNG7PQYM7vJQgmjaDC42oYj1pLnidJM/editsurvey"> survey</a> of 60 New Yorkers showed that 89% expressed concern about tap water contamination, with nearly a third saying they think about it "all the time."<br> <br>
        
        Their fears may be valid. A new data analysis of resident-requested lead pipe samples and citywide water tank inspections reveals that the water flowing from many taps is less safe than New Yorkers are led to believe.<br> <br></p>
        
        <h2>The Clean Water Capital</h2>

       <p>New York City has long touted its tap water as the “Champagne of Drinking Water” thanks to nearly 2,000 miles of protected source water upstate.<br><br> Unlike most cities <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/14/473806134/how-do-we-get-our-drinking-water-in-the-u-s#:~:text=Coagulation%20and%20flocculation%20%2D%20Chemicals%20are,Allen%20for%20NPR%20hide%20caption">that rely on costly filtration plants</a> to clean river or aquifer water, <a href="https://cwconline.org/#:~:text=The%20Catskill%20Delaware,New%20York%20State.">90%</a> of New York’s source water requires no filtration, using only UV light and chlorine to eliminate harmful microbes and bacteria. The Catskill/Delaware and Croton Reservoirs—NYC’s primary water sources—are protected by the 1997 Land Acquisition Program, which enables the city to preserve watershed land and prevent contamination from runoff. <br> <br>
        “We help residents keep their farms running while protecting reservoirs from agricultural pollution,” says Heather Magnan of the NYC Watershed Council, noting that the program has steadily strengthened water quality standards over the past 30 years.<br> <br>
        
        Given these strong protections at the source, it’s no surprise that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/water/drinking-water/drinking-water-supply-quality-report/2024-drinking-water-supply-quality-report.pdf">reports</a> clean results from the 1,000 street-side sampling stations it monitors each year. But these results only reflect water quality before it enters private buildings—not what actually comes out of the tap.</p> <br><br>

          "New York City’s water is very well-protected. The contaminants to worry about in NYC are in the pipelines and tanks, like metals getting dissolved from the lines, or the microbes and biofilms sloughing off and getting into the water,” says Lokesh Padhye, Associate Director of Emerging Contaminants Research at the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology.

          <h2>Inside The City’s Quiet Lead Crisis</h2>
          <br>
          
          <p>
          Once water enters a building’s private lines, it’s no longer under the city’s jurisdiction—owners are responsible for their own water lines. Though new lead pipes were <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/real-estate-disclosures-about-potential-lead-hazards">banned decades ago</a>, a <a href="https://nylcvef.org/wp-content/uploads/no-excuses-lead-report.pdf">report</a> conducted by the New York League of Conservation Voters found that there are 124,197 confirmed lead service lines across the city, and another 124,917 that may have lead—a total of <span style="font-weight: bold;">30%</span> of the city’s supply. Replacing these lead pipes can cost owners anywhere from <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-would-it-cost-to-replace-all-the-nations-lead-water-pipes/">a thousand to several million dollars</a>, depending on building size.<br><br>
          Lead is one of the most dangerous contaminants in drinking water, known to cause neurological defects, reproductive issues, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6104a1.htm">a host of other health problems</a>. Despite a federal law allowing water systems to have a maximum lead concentration of 15 parts per billion, <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/lead">experts say</a> any level of lead is hazardous to humans.<br><br>
          The DEP’s 2024 drinking water report notes that “Homes built prior to 1961 may have lead service lines, and some homes, regardless of the year they were built, could have household plumbing and interval fixtures that contain lead.” 
          <br> <br> The only way for residents to know for sure if their apartment’s water contains lead is to request a testing kit from the city. These tests are free, but results can take months to come back.
          </p>
          
          <figure style="float: right; width: 400px; margin: 10px 0 10px 20px; text-align: center;">
            <img src="PHOTOS/TapTestDraws.jpg" alt="DEP lead test jugs" style="width: 100%;">
            <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 5px;">
              The DEP's free lead test kits are the only way to know for certain if your water contains lead.

          <p>
          An analysis of all <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Free-Residential-at-the-tap-Lead-and-Copper-Data/k5us-nav4/about_datacollected">38,943</a> resident-requested tap samples  between 2014 and 2023 showed that 1251 samples, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">3% of tests</span>, were over the federal legal limit of 15 µg/L.<br><br>
          
          Over-limit samples were, on average, <span style="font-weight: bold;">8.8 times</span> above the legal limit.
          </p>
          
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #ccc; border-left: 4px solid #66ccff; padding-left: 15px; margin: 30px 0;">
            “This level of lead is alarming, especially because it is well-documented that there is no safe level of lead for humans,” says Padhye.
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>
          The zipcodes with the highest number of samples surpassing the legal lead limit were 11215, 11238, and 11121, located in Brooklyn's Park Slope, Prospect Heights, and Bushwick neighborhoods. The average lead level in these over-limit samples was <span style="font-weight: bold;">242 µg/L, or 1613%</span> of the federal Maximum Contaminant regulation.<br><br>
          Even if your water receives a negative lead result, that may not mean your water is completely lead-free. According to the DEP’s drinking water report, “The DEP cannot control the variety of materials used in the private plumbing in your home. Because lead levels may vary over time, lead exposure is possible even when your tap sampling results do not detect lead at one point in time.”<br><br>
          A <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/proposed-lead-and-copper-rule-improvements">federal law</a> passed in October 2024 requires that all lead pipes in the nation be replaced by 2037, but even with federal funding, this project will cost New York State $2.7 billion. Weeks before this law, Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/746-24/mayor-adams-expands-free-program-replace-private-lead-water-lines-low-income-neighborhoods#/0">launched a program</a> to replace lead pipe lines in the Bronx and Queens, but these replacements will only tackle 0.002% of confirmed lead pipe service lines citywide.<br><br>
          Based on these analyses, between <span style="font-weight: bold;">half a million and 111,000 apartments</span> may have above-limit lead levels in their tap water. Because these samples were only taken from residents who requested them, these averages may not be representative. Widespread lead contamination testing by the city is needed to assess current city-wide contamination levels.<br><br>
          The DEP did not respond to request for comment about public health risks in the city's water lines or future efforts to mitigate public health impact.

            A water tower serving floors six and above in Midtown Manhattan.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Another potential source of tap water contamination is building water tanks, introduced in the 1880s to supply floors above the fifth, where city water pressure can’t reach. Traditional tanks sit on rooftops, while newer pressurized versions may be in basements or nearby buildings.<br> <br></p> 
          
          <p>Owners are <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/environmental/watertank-insp-faq.pdf">required by law</a> to inspect their water tanks for contaminants each year, but only half of the city’s water tanks have been inspected since 2020. Of those inspected, <span style="font-weight: bold;">72 tanks</span> were found to have contamination of some kind: sediment, biological growth, insect debris, rodent or bird droppings, and/or the presence of coliform or EColi. Bird poop or E.coli contamination in drinking water can cause fungal and bacterial infections that can be serious. Those with weakened immune systems are at even greater risk of harm. According to the New York State Department of Health, state and local health departments collaborate to provide oversight of public water supplies throughout the state, ensuring appropriate treatment of more than 100 contaminants and removing or inactivating pathogens.<br><br></p> 

            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #ccc; border-left: 4px solid #66ccff; padding-left: 15px; margin: 30px 0;">
              "Pathogens such as E. Coli, Cyrptosporodium, and Giardia in water supplies remain the most important to regulate, since these contaminants can impact large numbers of people in a short period of time," said the New York State Department of Health's Erin Clary.
            </blockquote> 
          <p>However, water tanks and service lines—the two primary sources of contamination for New York City Residents—are privately owned and fall outside of government oversight. This regulatory blind spot leaves millions of city residents vulnerable to the health risks of contaminanted drinking water. The New York City Department of Health declined to comment on these risks.</p>
